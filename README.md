Our program allows two users to take turns to play a game of tic-tac-toe. The player can input which field they would like to choose by first entering the row number and then the column number they would choose. The top row is row 0, the bottom row is row 2. The leftmost column is column 0, the rightmost column is column 2. The code can be run by using the make command and then typing ./main into the command line.
